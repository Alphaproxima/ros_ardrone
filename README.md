# ros_ardrone : A ROS Stack for ARDrone

## Introduction

"ros_ardrone" is a [ROS](http://ros.org/ "Robot Operating System") stack for [Parrot AR-Drone](http://http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/select-site) quadrocopter. This stack is based on "ardrone_autonomy". "ardrone_autonomy" has been developed in [Autonomy Lab](http://autonomy.cs.sfu.ca) of [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca) by [Mani Monajjemi](http://sfu.ca/~mmonajje).

## Goal

In this package i will try to collect all ardrone ros things i can find and also develop some basics for the ardrone. I hope there will be some people out there, who will use and/or develop further things to this package. So feel free to contact me.
